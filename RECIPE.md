The recipe is as follows:
In a colander, drain the pasta and keep aside.

Making Sauce For Pasta Arrabiata

Peel and roughly chop 2 large tomatoes (220 grams). Add them in a blender or a food chopper or processor.

Without adding any water, blend to a smooth puree. Keep aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pan. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Saute for some seconds.

Then add 2 teaspoons crushed red chili flakes and stir. You can reduce or increase the quantity of red chili flakes as required. Instead or red chili flakes, you can also add ½ teaspoon red chilli powder.

Next, add the tomato puree. Add salt as per taste and mix very well. Cover the pan with its lid.

On a low flame simmer the sauce till the raw flavor and taste of tomatoes goes away. Add some water (about ¼ cup) if the tomato puree start sticking to the pan.

When you see some oil specks on the sauce, this means that the tomato puree is cooked.

Making Arrabiata Pasta

Then add ¼ teaspoon dried oregano, ¼ teaspoon black pepper. You can also add ¼ teaspoon sugar, if the tomatoes are too tangy, then only add sugar. Mix very well. You can add sugar as required depending on the tanginess of tomatoes.

Add the cooked pasta and mix very well, so that the sauce coats the pasta evenly.

Switch off the flame and add 1 teaspoon chopped basil leaves. Mix again.

Serve arrabiata pasta hot or warm with some vegetarian parmesan cheese grated on top. You can also use grated processed cheese if you do not have vegetarian parmesan cheese.
